    <div style="text-align: left;">
      Are you a designer? Are you an artist? If you are then you are gonna love
      HTML. But if your sense of art has not evolved beyond the average stone
      age male(true in my case), you are still gonna love HTML because the kind
      of stuff you can develop using HTML, tugs at your most basic primal
      instinct of beauty. My first experience of HTML was  in my preteens. I
      was like a 12 year kid interested to see how all the colorful websites I
      saw on the computer worked. But once I got to know that there is so much
      of stuff to be remembered I just got bored and I moved on. Later on I had
      to work on HTML since my job demanded it. But it was the most basic of
      stuff which I could do. It was at this time I heard of something
      called <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">CSS</a>. I
      also realized that a website designed for one particular browser may not
      work as anticipated in another. In some cases it was not even backward
      compatible with the previous versions of the same browsers. I saw some
      grown men cry. In frustration,anger,desperation and a few times in
      happiness.

      This was quite a scary scene to look at and I blanched at the whole
      thought of getting my hands dirty with HTML. Even from my experience it
      looked like the HTML was very moody. It would structure everything
      properly if it was happy. Else if was angry it was would act so crazy
      that your Ex would seem like an angel(The metaphor is not altogether
      correct but I am sure you get the point). So what changed today that I am
      writing about this? Well for one I have decided that I'll no longer be
      just a coder but will strive to be a programmer. So in this long journey
      the basic criteria is that you have a passion to learn. So where better
      to start learning than HTML. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/"
      target="_blank">HTML</a>(Hyper Text Markup Language) is not a programming
      language. Rather it is a language used to structure websites. There are
      something called tags which are used to structure the website. Example-
      <span style="color: red;"><span style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px;">&lt;html&gt;</span><br style="background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      <span style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px;">&lt;body&gt;</span><br style="background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      <br style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      <span style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px;">&lt;h1&gt;My
      new page.&lt;/h1&gt;</span><br style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      <br style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      <span style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px;">&lt;p&gt;I
      can write something here which people will want to
      read.&lt;/p&gt;</span><br style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      <br style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      <span style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px;">&lt;/body&gt;</span><br style="background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      <span style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px;">&lt;/html&gt;</span></span>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      The tags, such as &lt;html&gt;,&lt;body&gt; are defined within angular
      brackets.The scope of the tag is from the  the end tag defined by using a
      '/' before the name of the tag. So as seen in the example the first tag
      is &lt;html&gt; tag. This is used to designate all the stuff written till
      &lt;/html&gt; is specified using HTML format. So basically the tags are
      like a fence on a ranch. So if you forget to close your fence you better
      be ready to be stamped upon by a lot of code. Mooooo!!!!! <span style=
      "font-family: inherit;">Tip </span>- Always check if you have closed all
      the tags. The tags can have attributes which will describe that specific
      tag. The attributes are specified within quotes. Example-
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <span style="color: red;">&lt;p id='my_para_id'
      name='my_para_name'&gt;........&lt;/p&gt;</span> There are a lot of tags
      to be learnt on HTML. One good resource to refer for the semantics of
      HTML is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">http://www.w3schools.com</a>.
      But designing a website is not only about structuring. You need to style
      it i.e make it presentable. That's where CSS comes into picture. HTML is
      blueprint. You can visualize and structure a house using the blueprint.
      But to live in the house you would want it to be painted, decorated and
      with all the rooms in the right place. So CSS is fundamentally like
      wood/wallpaper/furniture. You can position,color and do lots more with
      CSS.

            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>The image above shows the basic CSS syntax. There are 3 ways of
      placing CSS,
    </div>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li>External Style sheet : This is used when a lot many web pages are to
      be styled similarly. Here are the CSS styles are specified in a single
      file, a .css file, which will be referred by all the pages which are to
      look similar. The benefit of using this (I am sure the programmers out
      there are comparing this to a common function) is that you need to repeat
      the same styles over and over again. Also if the look of the web pages
      are to be changed, then changing in one place(i.e the css file) will
      replicate the changes across all the pages.
      </li>
      <li>Internal Style sheet : This is used when one particular web page is
      to be styled differently from the others. Here the the styles are
      specified in a specific section of the HTML. The styles specified here
      are local to the HTML document in which the styles are specified.
      </li>
      <li>Inline : This is used when only when one element(tag) is to be styled
      differently.
      </li>
    </ul>There is no hard and fast rule for placing the CSS. But normally
    External Style Sheet is the best way to go. Also the performance is
    improved in case of external style sheet as the browser can cache the style
    and need to reload the whole file every time. But ultimately I guess it
    just depends on what the situation requires to take a call on where the
    style sheet should be specified. Tip - Using external style sheet also
    helps you to inherit style from parent elements which means even lesser
    lines of code. Being lazy is the way to being efficient. Also it's a very
    good practice to use comments to describe the HTML and CSS you have
    written. This makes your code all the more readable to you and also to
    others.(For some reason people just hate to comment their code/markup. But
    they will happily comment for hours about the hot new colleague who just
    joined work.) Now that I talked about the part which can be tangibly learnt
    to design a web page I would like to touch upon the more important and
    harder part of designing GOOD web-pages. And that is, no prizes for
    guessing, the designing itself. This in my opinion is the toughest thing to
    do and you need a lot of time,effort and criticism from others to develop.
    Designing good web pages is like art. You need to love what you are doing
    to succeed in it. You also need to be selfless(Na don't worry. I ain't
    asking you to sell your Ferrari and become a monk.) Selfless as in stop
    thinking what you want out of you website and start thinking of what the
    people who will be using it want. There a lot of websites out there which
    have crammed up so much of information on their sites that looking at them
    makes you remember the last time you overeaten the thanks giving turkey.
    You eyes feel blinded not from the brilliance of the site but from
    the sheer amount crazy glitter and you 'll be scrambling frantically to get
    the hell out that web page. The simple philosophy I will follow is simple
    is beautiful. May be not HOT but definitely beautiful. Some tips which I
    found out are,
    <div>
      <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>Keep is simple and straight forward. Do not display more than
        required.
        </li>
        <li>Represent all the stuff uniformly so that the users don't get
        confused.
        </li>
        <li>Ensure proper color contrast and text readability.
        </li>
        <li>Ensure a proper site map.
        </li>
        <li>Keep working and iterating on you web page.
        </li>
        <li>Get criticisms from people and take in all that on which you can
        improve your awesome website.
        </li>
      </ul> There are so many awesome,brilliant designers out there who have
      designed so many beautiful pages.( Sometimes it makes you wonder don't
      their wives/husbands get jealous as their better halves(many would
      disagree) are spending so much time with their beloved beautiful mistress
      WEB PAGES!!!.) But on a more serious notes these guys are brilliant and
      artistic. Many claim that they design so awesomely as they kept on
      working passionately to design web pages which were dear to the eye. One
      good site which I came across which talks about good design is <a href=
      "http://www.visualmess.com/" target="_blank">Clean Up You Mess : A guide
      to visual design</a>.

      For all the beginners out there like me don't worry. We have some really
      good friends in the maze we have jumped into. They are the developer
      tools. They will help you to debug your webpage if required. Every
      browser has it's own developer tool, either shipped along or needed to
      added separately. Also there is no end to learning. Every year HTML and
      CSS evolves. So go ahead. Give HTML and CSS a shot. You may end designing
      what people may call the epitome of beauty some day.

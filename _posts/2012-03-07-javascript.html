   Are you bored of a static webpage? Do you feel like your web page sits
      there feeling so depressed? Do you wish that your page was more
      responsive? Yes there's a solution to you problem. Use JavaScript. Na
      don't go on the name. Its not "that" java its the one which can make you
      web page dance(Grab crotch.Moonwalk").
        JavaScript is

      All
      the hi-fi terminology aside, JavaScript is a programming language for
      your web browser using which you can control the html elements in your
      webpage. JavaScript is an <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" style=
      "background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: none; background-origin: initial;  line-height: 18px; text-align: -webkit-auto; "
      title="Object-oriented programming">object-oriented</a> language which
      means everything(almost) is an object. It is case sensitive(many 'duh'
      moments if you forget this) and also it is a weakly typed language. I
      always used to assume that weakly typed used to mean you can write
      whatever crap you wanted and it would run. But now I realized that what I
      had ass+u+ me(d) was so wrong of the mark. Weakly typed,
      among many other things, means there is a lot of implicit type
      conversions happening. I'll get to what this means later.
      The main reasons
      behind using JavaScript is to do all the computation which are
      independent from the server on the client(browser) end and to make the
      page more dynamic. This means that it saves a lot of time since it is
      being done at the browser locally. But this again poses challenges such
      as longer load times because of the additional complexity and also
      security issues. Before I would comment on whether to use JavaScript or
      not I'll give a brief idea about JavaScript. JavaScript provides the
      following,
          A simple way
          to program for HTML designers.
          Validate
          data entered by users.
          Add or
          delete HTML elements dynamically using  <a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model" target=
          "_blank">DOM</a> .
          Define
          behavior of a page on basis of some event.
      Before I
      start, I am assuming you know the basics of HTML and CSS and therefore
      can create a static webpage. JavaScript is written in the
      script tag. Example: 
      <html><br style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      <body><br style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      <br style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      <h1>My First Web Page</h1><br style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      <br style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      <script type="text/javascript"> document.write("<p>" + Date()
      + "</p>"); </script><br style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      <br style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      </body><br style=
      "background-color: white; font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 13px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">
      </html> The example above
      will write a <p> tag and insert the current system time in the
      <p></p> tag.Each HTML document
      loaded into a browser window becomes a Document
      object.The
      Document object provides access to all HTML elements in a page, from
      within a script.
        Using
        JavaScript you get total control over the webpage and manipulate it you
        liking(Like the vamp of a soap).You can even manipulate the styles in a
        page using JavaScript.You can bind
        JavaScript to some elements such as buttons and do some specific
        actions once the button is clicked. Such user actions are called as
        events. JavaScript also allows you to specify functions.
        These functions can take in arguments and can called and are similar to
        the functions in C.There is
        a lot of stuff on JavaScript out there on the internet. You can
        refer  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" style=
        "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;" target=
        "_blank">W3Schools</a> for all
        the different semantics on JavaScript. I would
        like to share about something what people consider to be TABOO in
        JavaScript(A bit advanced so you can probably continue only if you have
        fair idea about value types in JavaScript). Implicit
        Conversion(Boooo Hoooooo) JavaScript
        implicitly converts the type of a object in many scenarios. One of the
        most common scenarios it while coercion. When using the '==' operator
        JavaScript implicitly coerce's the type of the two operands. This
        totally freaks many of the controlling freaks out there as they cannot
        control what's happening. Many even suggest not to use '==' operator.
        But that imho is sad because if you are a programmer you should
        understand what exactly is happening and use this automatic conversion
        to your use. JavaScript
        has basically two types of values. Primitive:
          Null: The
          valuenull.
          Undefined:
          The valueundefined.
          Number: All
          numbers, such as0 and 3.14.
            AlsoNaN,
            andInfinity.
          Boolean: The
          valuestrue and false.
          String: All
          strings, such as"foo" and "".
          Non-Primitive:
              All other
              values are non-primitive, including arrays, functions, and plain
              old objects. 
        So what
        happens when using '==' operator for comparison between different type
        is that either one or both operands will be converted to a single type
        and they will compared. This is a very confusing thing if you don't
        know what exact type and value the operands will be converted
        to.  The
        table below tabulates the different conversions which happens during
        implicit coercing when in the following scenario(source: <a href=
        "http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/truth-equality-and-javascript/">truth-equality-and-javascript</a> 
         <a href="http://www.blogger.com/"></a> ),
         x==y
                 <a href=
                "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5qaIsYXmas4/T1djaKGS-WI/AAAAAAAAACM/aqmy9wH-ud4/s1600/coerce.jpg"

                </a> 
        The
        table below shows the type the operands get converted to after the
        toNumber and toPrimitive functions,
         <a href=

        *NaN-Not A Number
        Most of
        the types are coerced to numbers. I will try to explain the tables with
        the following examples,
        Examples:
        1) 123 == ‚&#128;&#156;123‚&#128;ù 
        Inner Workings:
        Type(123) is integer <=> No
        Coercion 
        Type("123") is
        string. => toNumber("123") => 123 i.e final type after coercion is
        number(123) <=> Coercion
        Hence 123 == "123"
        => 123 == 123 => true
        2)  true
        == 1
        Inner Workings:
        Type(true) is boolean. => toNumber(true) => 
        1 
        i.e final type after coercion is number(1)
        <=> Coercion
        Type(1) is number <=> No
        Coercion
        Hence true == 1 => 1 == 1 =>
        true
        3)  false == "0"
        Inner Workings:
        Type(false) is boolean =>
        toNumber(false) => 0 i.e
        final type after coercion is number(0) <=>
        Coercion
        Type("0") is
        string. => toNumber("0") => 0 i.e
        final type after coercion is number(0) <=> Coercion
        Hence false == "0" => 0 == 0 =>
        true
        4)  [] == ''
        Inner Workings:
        Type([]) is object => toPrimitive([]) => [].valueOf() gives no
        value => [].toString() => '0' =>  
         0 i.e
        final type after coercion is number(0)  <=>
        Coercion
        Type('') is string => toNumber("")
         => 0 to i.e
        final type after coercion is number(0) <=> Coercion
        Hence [] == ''
        => 0 == 0 => true
        As shown in the examples above the coercion is pretty much
        straightforward provided you know the rules. I referred to these
        awesome blogs to understand implicit coercion.

        Ultimately
        JavaScript is a tool. So therefore it is your call on how to use it.
        Use it as a hammer either to smash walnuts or to sculpt something
        amazing.

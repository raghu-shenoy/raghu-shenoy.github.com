      "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself.
      First Linux, now git."-<i>Linus Torvalds</i>
    </div>
    <blockquote class="tr_bq">
      <div style="text-align: justify;">
        (Note that Torvalds did not in fact name Linux.)
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      That's what Linus Torvalds, the developer of Linux and Git had to say
      when he was asked why did he name the free, fast and efficient <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control" target="_blank">Version
      Control System</a>(VCS), which he developed, as GIT . <u>The Reason</u>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <div style=
      "border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;">
      I guess most of us have worked with VCS at some point or the other. I had
      previously worked with a Subversion client to collaborate code with my
      team mates. In the beginning we ate up a lot of each others code(due to
      bad commits) as all of us where pretty new to the concept of VCS. There
      were a lot of sparks flying around and a lot of over writes being swept
      under the carpet. Finally we had a sit down with our boss who then gave
      us a crash course on  how to "diff" files before a commit, how to check
      out and so on. Things went on pretty well after that. But the biggest
      problem(Guilty Pleasure) which I found working with SVN was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottleneck" target=
        "_blank">Bottleneck</a>. Now in the SVN case, the
        "<u>single</u>" server was the bottle neck, the single point of
        failure. The server goes kaput the team goes on a tea break,sometimes a
        very long break. By kaput I mean the network goes down or some
        other similar problem due to which the code is
        temporarily not reachable. But say the code goes KAPUT(fried), and you
        have not backed up the data you as well might go and find a quiet
        corner to cry. <u>The Solution</u>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      Therefore when I realised this issue(I don't wanna be a cry baby) I
      started looking around for some options. It was at this point I came
      across GIT. The <b><u>DISTRIBUTED</u></b> CVS. This looked to me as the
      second coming because, 
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <ul>
        <li>Git is distributed.This means there are so many repositories that
        even if 1 fails,even if it is the sole remote repository hosted on
        github.com, I can still retrieve it from some other machine or my own
        machine and continue working. No more crying!
        </li>
        <li>The reason why there are so many repositories is because
        every machine handling that repository has once local repository. Yes
        you heard it right. No more network lag. This also means you can still
        work on git while you are offline and commit code to your local
        directory in case you have no access to the Internet/intranet. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      These were some of the reasons why I temporarily put aside learning the
      beauty of UNIX as my primary focus and started off with understanding
      GIT. In case you want to try out git you can follow these steps
    </div>
    <ol style="text-align: left;">
      <li>
        <div style=
        "border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; text-align: justify;">
        The first thing you need to do is register yourself at <a href=
        "https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>. The best part is its
        free*(How much we all love this term.This truly is the barrier breaker
        among cultures). *<span style="font-size: xx-small;">At least the
        public repositories</span>.[And how we hate the fine print]
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
          Once you have signed up <span style=
          "font-family: inherit;">you'll</span> be directed to a page which
          will explain to you in detail how to go about setting up your very
          own repository(both local and remote), the basic transactions between
          the local repository and the remote repository such as
          committing,pushing and fetching code.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
       One thing to be noted here before you actually start playing around with
      the repository you need to understand the whole procedure of how GIT
      works.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      In git a file has to go through a few states before it is actually safe,
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>When you create a new file it will be un-tracked. This means git
        just knows a file is present in the local working directory which it
        was previously unaware of.
        </li>
        <li>You then have to "<u>add</u>" the file to the Git which is like
        saying, "OK Mr. Git please mark and add this file so that when I
        commit, this particular file also gets committed."
        </li>
        <li>Then there's a "<u>commit</u>". This means you have committed your
        files to the local repository and you are safe.
        </li>
        <li style=
        "border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;">
        Finally you can push all your committed files to the remote repository
        and share with everyone your amazing piece of code.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div style=
    "border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; text-align: left;">
    You can get a more detailed explanation here : <a href=
    "http://progit.org/book/ch1-3.html" target="_blank">Git Basics</a>
    </div>
    <div style=
    "border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; text-align: left;">
    The other amazing thing about git is branching. With branching you can
    totally freak out on the code because you can branch out from the main code
    and all the changes you put in will be local to your branch and you wont be
    messing up any code written currently by others. Branching takes very less
    system resources in terms of space and also the time required for creating
    it.
    </div>
    <div style=
    "border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; text-align: left;">
    </div>
    <div style=
    "border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; text-align: left;">
    </div>
    <div style=
    "border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; text-align: left;">
    I went on to try all the basic git commands such as
    </div>
    <div style=
    "border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; text-align: left;">
    <ul>
        <li>add
        </li>
        <li>commit
        </li>
        <li>push
        </li>
        <li>branch
        </li>
        <li>checkout
        </li>
        <li>remote
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>My suggestion is that you need to first get comforatble with the
    whole concept of the different file statges. I along with my friends set
    up a team repository. And as they say too many cooks spoil the broth. And
    thus came along the merge conflicts from all of our constant tinkering. I
    learnt to resolve the conflicts(Wish I could say that about my relationship
    with some of my relatives.) For a GUI guy like me it just took a short
    while to get comfortable working on a terminal for a few days. Well that's
    not something I can brag about because I am still taking small baby
    (command) steps.

    The steps to set up Git is well documented at github.But I would like to
    share some errors which I encountered when I tried to setup Git for the
    first time and the solutions for them,

         I spent quite some time figuring this one out. Ensure that the name of
      the remote repository  and the local working directory are the same. Now
      there's a git working on GIT. 2. The other one- <b>error : 403</b>

        <u>Two Reasons</u> Your credentials are wrong.Try entering the correct
        credentials.                 OR When you cloned a particular repository
        you copied the url which I have encircled in the image below.<a href=

      If that is the case then either you can do a fresh clone from the
      repository. If you think that's not a feasible option then you can
      probably remove the remote and then add a new remote having the statement
      which you obtained at the encircled region in the image below. This also
      means you need not provide credentials everytime you push. <a href=

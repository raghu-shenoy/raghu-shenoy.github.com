        I have been a windows guy so far. First there was windows 95,then XP
        and currently Windows 7. But then I came across this particular article
        :<a href=
        "http://www.readability.com/read?url=http://catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s05.html"
        target="_blank">What Unix Gets Right</a>. I am the kind of guy who
        loves details. Lots and lots of details.<i> </i>I totally freak out on
        the details. So when this article promised me that I can get my hands
        dirty and interact with my computer as I could never before I got
        hooked. I am also the kind of guy who gets hooked onto things very
        easily but I kind of lose steam somewhere midway. But even as I thought
        about this this I took a leap of faith, into the dark black terminal,
        with only 1 blinking cursor as my companion and only friend.

        For all the GUI loving guys out there this is one crazy experience. For
        a person like me, who's grown up with only GUI, GUI is safe,known and
        easy. I need not take up any effort to learn any commands nor type
        anything on the console. I just point and click. But then then after I
        started using UNIX, I realised it is not as scary or as tough as I
        initially thought. All the basic commands are very intuitive and short
        forms of the English language. For people who like texting on
        their cellphones the UNIX console commands will be similar to that a
        cellphone GEN Y message.

        For all those who have decided to start to start UNIX (come on I am
        sure you have done even more crazier stuff) please say good bye to GUI
        and therefore also to the beloved mouse. The only friends you will get
        once you jump into UNIX are the cursor, the keyboard, the UNIX manual,
        the benevolent UNIX developers out there on the world wide web and your
        passion to write code and learn. But fear not. These few friends are
        more than enough for you to course through the basic stuff of UNIX.

        Before I continue I will like to state that I am a total newbie in UNIX
        and my experience in this language is very shallow. But I would also
        like to state that I have enjoyed learning and trying out this real fun
        language this short time.

        I started off learning UNIX from this amazing book by Zed Shaw
        -<a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/" target="_blank">The
        Command Line Crash Course</a>.This book deals with very basic unix
        commands and no hi fi Shell scripting. So all of you out there wanting
        to do some <u>advanced UNIX/shell programming this book is not for
        you</u>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>
        To be very honest I had studied about UNIX in my college days. But it
        was more of mugging up commands than actually appreciating this
        language and using this practically. So the commands felt like stuff 
        stored in the basement for quite a while which needed some dusting and
        polishing.
      </p>

        In the first chapter the command to be learnt was <u>pwd</u>( Print
        Working Directory ). Now isn't that intutive? The author also suggests
        as an excersise to type in this command 20 times. I hate repetative
        work. I find it very boring and I dread the very thought of repeating
        it 20 times. But then I thought, since I have decided to learn UNIX 
        let me atleast be thorough with it, and if this dude who is so
        experienced in UNIX is telling me to do this then I'll do it. Trust me
        writing those 3 alphabets over and over again 20 times is so boring.
        But I am sure I'll never ever forget "pwd" the rest of my life. After
        this excersise I went on to the next command "<u>hostname</u>"(get your
        computer name). And the same excersise, but now with 8 alphabets. I am
        like - you gotta be kidding me. But then I did that excersise and it
        really kind of drilled into me the command.( Again the command is so
        intutive ). I realised one thing, to be good at UNIX you need to
        practice. Practice so much that these basic commands feel like a part
        of your day to day vocabulary.

        I diligently practiced all the commands specified in this book. This
        helped me understand the file structure of UNIX, the fact that once you
        delete some file it's gone forever( Scary. But the scarier part is you
        dont even get a confirmation message wrt to the delete and its really
        very easy to delete the entire file system by mistake if you are not
        careful. )

        One interesting command I came across is the "<u>find</u>" command. The
        find in UNIX is very powerful. The reason why searching in UNIX is so
        powerful is because of something called <u><a href=
        "http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/cli-crash-coursech16.html#x22-7400016"
        target="_blank">wildcards</a></u>. These wildcards are the searcher's
        best friends. These wildcards help the users to be lazy and efficient
        while searching. Now for the guys using Windows and saying "Big Deal. I
        rather use the windows search" I thought I could ask - "How about
        finding text within the files?". Well I did not know that there was a
        way to actually do this. ( Check <a href=
        "http://www.howtogeek.com/99406/how-to-search-for-text-inside-of-any-file-using-windows-search/"
        target="_blank">this</a> if you want to know how to do it in
        windows. ) Well 1 each for both Windows and Unix on that. But in UNIX
        you need not under go the whole procedure. All you need is a simple
        "<u>grep</u>" command and voila you have all the files with the
        specific text neatly listed. And there are so many different options
        for the "<u>grep</u>" that you can omit and include infite(Ok that may
        be an exgarerration, may be a whole lot) number of filters on the text
        to be searched.Very very powerful. 2 - 1 and UNIX wins. The
        "<u>find</u>" + "<u>grep</u>" combo will let nothing slip out of your
        eyesight.
      </p>

    <div style="text-align: left;">

        Then there are the pipelines, the bridges between the UNIX command. I
        imagine that these are the reason why the UNIX commands be-friend each
        other and successfully provide a very specific output. There is also a
        shortcut to alternate between two directories using the "<u>pushd</u>"
        and "<u>popd</u>" commands. One thing I learnt here was that once you
        have pushed a directory on top of a stack and you then delete that
        particular directory, if you use "<u>pushd"</u> to go back to that
        directory it fails. What I mean to say is that deleting a folder which
        has been "<u>pushd</u>" wont remove it from the stack.

        I have been hooked on to this UNIX and I want to learn a lot more on
        UNIX. My next aim is to learn about shell programming and also to learn
        the fuctionalities of wildcards and regular expressions.Turns out the
        terror of the Black-ness Monster is very similar to that of the
        Loch-ness moster.Both are myths.

I have been a windows guy so far. First there was windows 95,then XP and currently Windows 7. But then I came across this particular article :<a href="http://www.readability.com/read?url=http://catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s05.html" target="_blank">What Unix Gets Right</a>. I am the kind of guy who loves details. Lots and lots of details.<i>&nbsp;</i>I totally freak out on the details. So when this article promised me that I can get my hands dirty and interact with my computer as I could&nbsp;never before I got hooked. I am also the kind of guy who gets hooked onto things very easily but I kind of lose steam somewhere midway. But even as I thought about this this I took a leap of faith, into the dark black terminal, with only 1 blinking cursor as my companion and only friend.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
For all the GUI loving guys out there this is one crazy experience. For a person like me, who's grown up with only GUI,&nbsp;GUI is safe,known and easy. I need not take up any effort to learn any commands nor type anything on the console. I just point and click. But then then after I started using&nbsp;UNIX, I realised it&nbsp;is not&nbsp;as scary or as tough as I initially thought. All the basic commands are very intuitive and short forms of the English language. For people who like texting on their&nbsp;cellphones the&nbsp;UNIX console commands&nbsp;will be similar to that a cellphone GEN Y message.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
For all those who have decided to start to start UNIX (come on I am sure you have done even more crazier stuff) please say good bye to GUI and therefore also to&nbsp;the beloved mouse. The only friends you will get once you jump into UNIX are the cursor, the keyboard, the UNIX manual, the benevolent UNIX developers out there on the world wide web and your passion to write code and learn. But fear not. These few friends are more than enough for you to course through the basic stuff of UNIX.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
Before I continue I will like to state that I am a total newbie in UNIX and my experience in this language is very shallow. But I would also like to state that I have enjoyed learning and trying out this real fun language this short time.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
I started off learning UNIX from this amazing book by Zed Shaw -<a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/" target="_blank">The Command Line Crash Course</a>.This book deals with very basic unix commands and no hi fi Shell scripting. So all of you out there wanting to do some <u>advanced UNIX/shell programming this book is not for you</u>.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
To be very honest I had studied about UNIX in my college days. But it was more of mugging up commands than actually appreciating this language and using this practically. So the commands felt like stuff&nbsp; stored in the basement for quite a while&nbsp;which needed some dusting and polishing. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
In the first chapter the command to be learnt was <u>pwd</u>( Print Working Directory ). Now isn't that intutive? The author also suggests as an excersise to type in this command 20 times.&nbsp;I hate repetative work. I find it very boring and I dread the very thought of repeating it&nbsp;20 times. But then I thought,&nbsp;since I have decided&nbsp;to learn UNIX&nbsp; let me atleast be thorough with it, and if this dude who is so experienced in UNIX is telling me to do this then I'll do it. Trust me writing those 3 alphabets over and over again 20 times is so boring. But I am sure I'll never ever forget "pwd" the rest of my life. After this excersise I went on to the next command "<u>hostname</u>"(get your computer name). And the same excersise, but now with 8 alphabets. I am like -&nbsp;you gotta be kidding me. But then I did that excersise and it really kind of drilled into me the command.( Again the command is so intutive ). I realised one thing, to be good at UNIX you need to practice. Practice so much that these basic&nbsp;commands feel like a part of your day to day vocabulary.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
I diligently practiced all the commands specified in this book. This helped me understand the file structure of UNIX, the fact that once you delete some file it's gone forever( Scary. But&nbsp;the scarier part is you dont&nbsp;even get a confirmation message wrt to the delete and its really very easy to delete the entire file system by mistake if you are not careful. )</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
One interesting command I came across is the "<u>find</u>" command. The find in UNIX is very powerful. The reason why searching in UNIX is so powerful is because of&nbsp;something called <u><a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/cli-crash-coursech16.html#x22-7400016" target="_blank">wildcards</a></u>. These wildcards are the searcher's best friends. These wildcards help the users to be lazy and efficient while searching. Now for&nbsp;the guys using Windows and saying "Big Deal. I rather use the windows search" I thought&nbsp;I could ask -&nbsp;"How about finding text within the files?". Well I did not&nbsp;know that there was a way to actually do this. ( Check <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/99406/how-to-search-for-text-inside-of-any-file-using-windows-search/" target="_blank">this</a>&nbsp;if you want to know how to&nbsp;do it in windows.&nbsp;)&nbsp;Well 1 each for both Windows and&nbsp;Unix on that.&nbsp;But in&nbsp;UNIX you need not&nbsp;under go&nbsp;the whole procedure.&nbsp;All&nbsp;you need is a simple "<u>grep</u>" command and voila you have all the files with the specific text neatly listed. And there are so many different options for the "<u>grep</u>" that you can omit and include infite(Ok that may be an exgarerration, may be a whole&nbsp;lot) number of filters on the text to be searched.Very very powerful. 2 - 1 and UNIX wins.&nbsp;The "<u>find</u>" + "<u>grep</u>" combo will let nothing slip out of your eyesight.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
Then there are the pipelines, the bridges between the UNIX command. I imagine that these are the reason why the UNIX commands&nbsp;be-friend each other and successfully provide a very specific output. There is also a shortcut to alternate between two directories using the "<u>pushd</u>" and "<u>popd</u>" commands. One thing I learnt here was that once you have pushed a directory on top of a stack and you then delete that particular directory, if you use "<u>pushd"</u> to go back to that directory it fails. What I mean to say is that deleting a folder which has been "<u>pushd</u>" wont remove it from the stack.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
I have been hooked on to this UNIX and I want to learn a lot more on UNIX. My next aim is to learn about shell programming and also to learn the fuctionalities of wildcards and regular expressions.Turns out the terror of the&nbsp;Black-ness Monster is very similar to that of&nbsp;the Loch-ness moster.Both are myths.</div>
